Project Summary: Scrape the website basketballreference.com for specific players to obtain specific game statistics and automatically send e-mails to a small list of friends every morning to update after the previous days games. Works for any player who has played in the 2019-2020 season on the website.

Scraping: Used beautifulSoup to access basketballreference and go through multiple webpages to get to the correct player and correct season to pull the information. Stored data in a pandas dataframe, saved backups as a csv. 

Preparing email: used SMTP library to login to gmail account and send specific e-mails.

Automatic: used cron within MacBook to setup automatic running of python script. Setup personal MacBook to wake up one minute before script was scheduled to run so it ran every morning.

Program successfully ran during the NBA 2020 Bubble Restart season July and August 2020.
