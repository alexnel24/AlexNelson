Scraping: Used beautifulSoup to access basketballreference and go through multiple webpages to get to the correct player 
and correct season to pull the information. Stored data in a pandas dataframe, saved backups as a csv. 

Preparing email: used SMTP library to login to gmail account and send specific e-mails.

Automatic: used cron within MacBook to setup automatic running of python script. 
Setup personal MacBook to wake up one minute before script was scheduled to run so it ran every morning.

Program successfully ran during the NBA 2020 Bubble Restart season July and August 2020.
