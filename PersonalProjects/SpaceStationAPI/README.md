This project was in an effort to learn more about API's and the library requests

Explanation of Contents:
1. FinalizedSpaceStation.py - This is the script to run with Functions.py in the same directory
2. Functions.py - This is where the functions were created and stored that interact with the API
3. SpaceStationLearning.py - THIS FILE IS NOT NEEDED TO RUN. This was my notes from learning about the API and how to interact
