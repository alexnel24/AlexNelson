This project was made in an effort to learn more about API's and the library requests

The program connects to the International Space Station public API and gets the current number of people in Space and there names.</br>
It then prompts the user for input to get coordinates and then returns when the Space Station will be over those coordinates

Explanation of Contents:
1. FinalizedSpaceStation.py - This is the script to run with Functions.py in the same directory
2. Functions.py - This is where the functions were created and stored that interact with the API
3. SpaceStationLearning.py - THIS FILE IS NOT NEEDED TO RUN. This was my notes from learning about the API and how to interact
