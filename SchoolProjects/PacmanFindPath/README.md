This was an assignment done at the end of Data Structures and Algorithms class

Takes in a text file that shows a start and ending point with malls marked by "X"

I implemented a Breadth First Search to find an available path

Professor requested we don't put our entire solutions online but I have a snippet in bfs.java

bfs.java shows my implementation of a breadth first search that works off a self made class Node
