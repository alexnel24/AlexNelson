This was an assignment done at the end of Data Structures and Algorithms class

Takes in a text file that shows a start and ending point with malls marked by "X"

I implemented a Breadth First Search to find an available path

Professor requested we don't put our entire solutions online but I have a snippet in bfs.java

bfs.java shows my implementation of a breadth first search that works off a self made class Node

Contents:
1. bfs.java - my code for breadth first search
2. straight.txt - an example of a maze put into program
3. straightAlexSolution.txt - an example of maze solution output by program
4. bigMaze.txt - another example of input
5. bigMaze.txt - another example of solution output by program
