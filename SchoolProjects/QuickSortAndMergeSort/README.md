This assignment was to teach us both sorting strategies and recurisive functions. 

Our professor asked us not to put our entire code projects online.

I have however put my sorting functions in this directory so you can see how much I've learned about sorting!

Contents:

1. mergeSort.java - my implementation of mergesort that sorts the input array using mergeSort

2. quickSort.java - my implementation of quicksort that sorts the input array using quicksort.
